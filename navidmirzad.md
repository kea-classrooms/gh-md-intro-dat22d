<p> A short description of what you dream of working with - two years from now - when you graduate and enter the labour market as a full-fledged, full-time software developer. </p>
- I dream of working with either some sort of software development or IT-security. I dream of having an interesting job, and working together with an awesome team, and good colleagues. Most of all I look forward to being able to pay my bills on time and making life more interesting lol.
