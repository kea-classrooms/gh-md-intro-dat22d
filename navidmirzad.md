### Im currently working on:
* A prioritized list of Programming languages and technologies you wanna work with.

* A link to all your public repositories on GitHub.

* Your GMail (if you have more, than just the one you'd like to use for sharing documents).

* A short description of what you dream of working with - two years from now - when you graduate and enter the labour market as a full-fledged, full-time software developer.


### As you progress with the items on the list - come back to this issue and check out the items.

### When you are all done commit the issue** (try to make the commit message a clever one).
